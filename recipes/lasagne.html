    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber
      of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from
      the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk
      added or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These
      are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs
      and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.
